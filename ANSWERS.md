# Responses:

### System Design ###
1. It is a pretty cool app there is a lot that i would have done differently completely separating the backend from the front end.
2. The coding style, also that if the app was to grow components and templates would be very hard to maintain, there are a lot of api calls and no caching is used, a lot of the responses are logged to the console rather than back to the user. 
3. I did make a few css changes however the responsiveness was not really great which means that usability for end users would be difficult. Mainly the user experience they should enjoy working on the application everything should be easy to find


## About the test

1. Pretty good test I do however, feel that you can let participants know that they should start the whole process when they will be free as juggling time between current employer and completion of the test in as much as I would like to join your team but during the day I am contractually bound to work for my employer and provide my 100%.
2. Really enjoyed it just time frame, I would have enjoyed more backend tasks.
3. yes the instructions were clear in the set up but as you will see I had to create seeds and do changes on the api application.
